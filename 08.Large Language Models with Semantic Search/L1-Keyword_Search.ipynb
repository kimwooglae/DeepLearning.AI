In der Psychologie wurde er 1907 von James Rowland Angell in einem Aufsatz über Edward Bradford Titchener eingeführt. In der Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft wurde er seit den 1920er vom Prager linguistischen Kreis verwendet. Dort knüpfte Roman Jakobson an die Schule des Russischen Formalismus an und verwendete den Begriff „Strukturalismus“ erstmals 1929 in einem in der Prager Zeitschrift \"Čin\" auf Tschechisch unter dem Titel \"Romantischer Panslawismus – neue Slawistik\" (\"Romantické všeslovanství — nová slávistika\") veröffentlichten Aufsatz:Were we to comprise the leading idea of present-day science in its most various manifestations, we could hardly find a more appropriate designation than structuralism. Any set of phenomena examined by contemporary science is treated not as a mechanical agglomeration but as a structural whole, and the basic task is to reveal the inner, whether static or developmental, laws of this system. What appears to be the focus of scientific preoccupations is no longer the outer stimulus, but the internal premises of the development; now the mechanical conception of processes yields to the question of their functions.\n",
