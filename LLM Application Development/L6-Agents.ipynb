In Python, I can use the built-in `sorted` function with a custom sorting key. The key will be a function that takes a customer and returns a tuple of their last name and first name. The `sorted` function will then sort the customers based on these tuples. The tuples are compared lexicographically, so this will first sort by the last names and then by the first names. I will write and execute this code. \\nAction: Python_REPL\\nAction Input: \\n```python\\ncustomers = [['Harrison', 'Chase'], ['Lang', 'Chain'], ['Dolly', 'Too'], ['Elle', 'Elem'], ['Geoff', 'Fusion'], ['Trance', 'Former'], ['Jen', 'Ayai']]\\nsorted_customers = sorted(customers, key=lambda customer: (customer[1], customer[0]))\\nprint(sorted_customers)\\n```\\nObservation: [['Jen', 'Ayai'], ['Lang', 'Chain'], ['Harrison', 'Chase'], ['Elle', 'Elem'], ['Trance', 'Former'], ['Geoff', 'Fusion'], ['Dolly', 'Too']]\\n\\nThought:\"\n",
